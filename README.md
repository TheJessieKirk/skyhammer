# Skyhammer
Copyright Â© 2024 Jessie Kirk

**Skyhammer is in an early development stage and should not be used for anything other than tests!**

Skyhammer is a set of compilers and related development tools that enable Raspberry Pi computers to compile code for other systems.

## Project Goals
* Skyhammer must provide a set of cross-platform compilers and tools so developers can easily use their Raspberry Pis to make software for PCs running Linux or Microsoft Windows, and for Apple Macs.
* It must be fully up-to-date and as standalone as possible, able to [eat it's own dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).
* It must be as full-featured as possible ("everything turned on").
* It may support Raspberry Pi brambles in the future.
* Skyhammer may provide support for similar devices to Raspberry Pis.

## Testing
Skyhammer correctly makes software, including itself, on a [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/).
It successfully creates software that runs natively on Microsoft Windows 10.

## Supported Architectures, Systems and Languages
**Linux for Raspberry Pi (aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu):** Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran, Go, M2, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Rust<br>
**Microsoft Windows for PC (x86_64-w64-mingw32):** Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran, M2, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Rust
